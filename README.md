# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
